### ❗️ Prerequisites

Hey, Dev, before starting your tests and/or contributions in the application, it is necessary to have two things installed, the first one is our wonderful [GIT](https://git-scm.com), and the second, the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), in addition, of course, to a good text editor.

Well, with everything installed and ready, we can proceed to the step by step of how to run the application.

### 🕹️ Running the application

```bash
# First of all, clone this repo using GIT.
$ git clone <https://github.com/trybrito/jobscalc>

# Access the project folder from the command terminal.
$ cd .../jobscalc

# Install the package.json dependencies.
$ yarn / npm install

# Initialize the database.
$ yarn init-db

# Run the application server.
$ yarn dev

# And finally, access <http://localhost:3000> to see the application running on the local server.
